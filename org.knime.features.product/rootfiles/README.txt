KNIME Product
============================================================

Quickstart guide:
- Extract the archive (if you read this here, you likely already did so).
- Under Windows launch knime.exe, for Linux use knime (either double
  click in a file browser or execute it in a shell). For Mac OS X either 
  double click the knime.app in Finder or execute 
  /Applications/knime/knime.app/Contents/MacOS/knime in Terminal.
- KNIME will open and prompt for a workspace directory, where it will put 
  its project files. It will create an empty workflow in the selected 
  workspace so that you can immediately start assembling a workflow. 


How to get additional features:
  KNIME allows for an easy integration of new features. These often 
  come under a different license and therefore are not included in 
  this archive. For example an R integration feature 
  (http://www.r-project.org) is available. These features
  are installed via the KNIME update site. In KNIME click 
  "File -> Install KNIME extension...". Then select the features you want to
  install in the dialog. You need to restart KNIME after installing new
  extensions in order to get them activated.

  Note, the update site is also available as zip archive for offline
  installation. Refer to the knime.org website for details.
